## Abstract

In this project I am observing nba stats from 2015/2016. I am a basketball fan and love looking at players stats and seeing how well or how not well they are preforming on the court. In this particular project I will be observing the players who did do well in the 2015/2016 season. My dataset is based on players with the highest points per game average and along with finding correlations that relate to high scoring.

In under 250 words give a brief summary of the project so far.
