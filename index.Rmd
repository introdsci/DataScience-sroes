## Abstract

In this project I am gathering a Dataset for NCAA DI basketball stats. This dataset contains every player and school in DI for basketball. I will examine the two best conferences in the NCAA and determine the best teams for those conferences based on scoring. Furthermore I will examine games played based on position along with points scored on average by position.


### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

The overall scoring average (PPG) between the two best NCAA conferences in the nation (ACC and PAC 12) as well as the number of games each position player plays for the entire NCAA along with how many points each position player scores.

### 2. Model Planning and Building

The highest scoring players by points and if there on a ranked team or not. This will help us to predict if a high scoring player is on a ranked team or not.
